Hello to anyone finding this repository! This is a c library designed to be an introductory project at 42 schools.
It reimplements a bunch of clib functions, as well as providing some useful extra functions, such as a basic implementation of lists.
This version, all by me, has been updated with many extra useful functions that aren't part of the 42 project, and some of the project functions have been modified since I passed, so I can't guarantee it will pass Moulinette.
